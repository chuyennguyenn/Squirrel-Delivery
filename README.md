# Squirrel-Delivery

A mobile port of our very first game, *Squirrel Delivery*, originally developed over the span of about two months.

Shoutout to my awesome teammates: Mercy Swinney, Drishti Shrestha, and Hisashi Tagai — and to the best-of-the-best professor and advisor: Jaime Spacco.

## Disclaimer

This was, first and foremost, a PC game. The mobile port is a personal project I started while learning Android Studio, with the goal of bringing some of my past games to mobile.

It’s been quite a while since I last opened this project, so expect a few bugs here and there.

*Squirrel Delivery* was the first game I worked on in a professional setting, and I’ve grown pretty attached to it.  
One day, I’ll return to clean it up and improve it — but for now, life has me focused elsewhere.
